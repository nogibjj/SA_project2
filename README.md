# Project 2: Bash command-line tool to clean and truncate data
The key objective of this project was to build a bash command-line tool that performs a useful data preparation task such as truncating data, sortiung it, cleaning data, or doing ETL.

The motivation for this tool was to alleviate some of the computational stress that comes with cleaning data. Data cleaning is the most important step in EDA but it typically takes up ~50% of project work time and some cleaning operations are mundane but universal among data sets. This tool takes basic operations like merging,
