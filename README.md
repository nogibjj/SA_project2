The key objective of this project was to build a bash command-line tool that performs a useful data preparation task such as truncating data, sortiung it, cleaning data, or doing ETL. 

## Purpose and Motivation
The purpose of the tool I have built is to take in preprocessed data and execute data cleaning tasks like merging multiple data files, removing observations with missing data and then split data based on column values. 

The motivation for this tool was to alleviate some of the computational stress that comes with cleaning data. Data cleaning is the most important step in EDA but it typically takes up ~50% of project work time and some cleaning operations are mundane but universal among data sets. This tool takes basic operations like merging,
