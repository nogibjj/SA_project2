# Project 2: Bash command-line tool to clean and truncate data
The key objective of this project was to build a bash command-line tool that performs a useful data preparation task such as truncating data, sortiung it, cleaning data, or doing ETL. 

## Purpose and Motivation
The purpose of the tool I have built is to take in un-processed data, and with user input, remove observations with missing data and split data based on column values.
